# Welcome

You could find my personal website <a href="https://longhoangphi225.github.io" style="text-decoration:none"> here </a>.
Please feel free to clone my repo for creating your personal website.
Note:
- If you build your website in local, set `theme                  : "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"` in file `_config.yml` and then run by: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- If you deploy your website in github, set `remote_theme           : "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes"` in file `_config.yml` and push your project.
